v3:
- Allow bpf_sk_assign helper to replace previously selected socket only
  when BPF_SK_LOOKUP_F_REPLACE flag is set, as a precaution for multiple
  programs running in series to accidentally override each other's verdict.
- Let BPF program decide that load-balancing within a reuseport socket group
  should be skipped for the socket selected with bpf_sk_assign() by passing
  BPF_SK_LOOKUP_F_NO_REUSEPORT flag. (Martin)
- Extend struct bpf_sk_lookup program context with an 'sk' field containing
  the selected socket with an intention for multiple attached program
  running in series to see each other's choices. However, currently the
  verifier doesn't allow checking if pointer is set.
- Use bpf-netns infra for link-based multi-program attachment. (Alexei)
- Get rid of macros in convert_ctx_access to make it easier to read.
- Disallow 1-,2-byte access to context fields containing IP addresses.

v2:
- Make bpf_sk_assign reject sockets that don't use RCU freeing.
  Update bpf_sk_assign docs accordingly. (Martin)
- Change bpf_sk_assign proto to take PTR_TO_SOCKET as argument. (Martin)
- Fix broken build when CONFIG_INET is not selected. (Martin)
- Rename bpf_sk_lookup{} src_/dst_* fields remote_/local_*. (Martin)
- Enforce BPF_SK_LOOKUP attach point on load & attach. (Martin)
