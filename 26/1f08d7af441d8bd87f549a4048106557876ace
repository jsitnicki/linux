- Make bpf_sk_assign reject sockets that don't use RCU freeing. (Martin)
- Rename src_/dst_* fields in struct bpf_sk_lookup to remote_/local_,
  respectively. (Martin)
- Change bpf_sk_assign helper proto to take PTR_TO_SOCKET as
  argument. (Martin)
- Allow sk_lookup programs to select only sockets that use RCU freeing.
  Update bpf_sk_assign docs accordingly. (Martin)
